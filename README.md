# 🧠 ML & AI Playground

Welcome to my **Machine Learning & AI Learning** Repo!  
This repository is where I document my journey of learning, experimenting, and building projects in **Machine Learning**, **Deep Learning**, and **AI** in general.

---

## 🚀 About

This repo is a collection of:
- 🔹 Hands-on experiments and practice notebooks  
- 🔹 Mini-projects exploring key ML and AI concepts  
- 🔹 streamlit-based projects for serving and deploying models

## 🧩 What I’ve Learned So Far

✅ **Python for Data Science**  
✅ **Machine Learning basics (Scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas)**  
✅ **Deep Learning fundamentals (Neural Networks, TensorFlow basics)**  
✅ **Flask – for building and serving ML models as web apps**

> I recently learned how to use **Flask** to build simple ML APIs and deploy trained models — turning ideas into real, working applications.

## 🧠 Next Steps

📍 Continue exploring:
- Model optimization and hyperparameter tuning  
- Neural network architectures (CNNs, RNNs, Transformers)  
- Deploying ML models on cloud platforms  
- Integrating AI with modern web apps
