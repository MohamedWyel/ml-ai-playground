    "# 04. Distance of a Point from a Plane\n",
    "\n",
    "This document covers the mathematical concept of calculating the shortest distance between a point and a plane (or Hyperplane in higher dimensions). This concept is fundamental in analytical geometry and has pivotal applications in Machine Learning, such as in Support Vector Machines (SVM) algorithms.\n",

    "## 1. The Core Concept\n",
    "\n",
    "The distance we are referring to is the **Orthogonal Distance**, which is the shortest distance between a specific point and a plane.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we have:\n",
    "* **Point $P$**: Defined by its coordinate vector $\\mathbf{x}_0$.\n",
    "* **Plane (Hyperplane) $\\Pi$**: Defined by the linear equation $\\mathbf{w}^T\\mathbf{x} + b = 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then the distance $d$ between the point and the plane is given by the following general formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$d = \\frac{|\\mathbf{w}^T\\mathbf{x}_0 + b|}{\\|\\mathbf{w}\\|}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "* $\\mathbf{w}$: Is the Normal Vector to the plane.\n",
    "* $b$: Is the Bias term (Intercept).\n",
    "* $\\|\\mathbf{w}\\|$: Is the Euclidean Norm or the length of the vector $\\mathbf{w}$.\n",

    "## 2. Special Cases (from 2D to n-D)\n",
    "\n",
    "### A. In 2D: Distance of a point from a straight line\n",
    "In two-dimensional space, a plane is simply a straight line.\n",
    "* **Line Equation**: $ax + by + c = 0$ (here $\\mathbf{w} = [a, b]^T$ and $b_{bias} = c$)\n",
    "* **Point**: $(x_0, y_0)$\n",
    "* **Distance Formula**:\n",
    "    $$d = \\frac{|ax_0 + by_0 + c|}{\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. In 3D: Distance of a point from a plane\n",
    "In three-dimensional space, we deal with a flat plane.\n",
    "* **Plane Equation**: $ax + by + cz + d = 0$ (here $\\mathbf{w} = [a, b, c]^T$ and $b_{bias} = d$)\n",
    "* **Point**: $(x_0, y_0, z_0)$\n",
    "* **Distance Formula**:\n",
    "    $$d = \\frac{|ax_0 + by_0 + cz_0 + d|}{\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. In n-Dimensions: Distance of a point from a Hyperplane\n",
    "This is the general case used in data science.\n",
    "* **Hyperplane Equation**: $w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + \\dots + w_nx_n + b = 0$\n",
    "* **Point**: $\\mathbf{x} = [x_1, x_2, \\dots, x_n]^T$\n",
    "* **Distance Formula (Vector notation)**:\n",
    "    $$d = \\frac{|\\mathbf{w}^T\\mathbf{x} + b|}{\\|\\mathbf{w}\\|}$$\n",
    "    Where $\\|\\mathbf{w}\\| = \\sqrt{w_1^2 + w_2^2 + \\dots + w_n^2}$\n",
