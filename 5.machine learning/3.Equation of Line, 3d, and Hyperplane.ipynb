    "# 03. Equation of Line, 3D Plane, and Hyperplane\n",
    "\n",
    "This document summarizes the mathematical definitions and geometric interpretations of lines, planes, and their n-dimensional generalizations (hyperplanes), based on the provided lecture notes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Equation of a Line (2D)\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2D space, a line can be represented in several forms:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Slope-Intercept Form\n",
    "$$y = mx + c$$\n",
    "* **m**: Slope of the line.\n",
    "* **c**: y-intercept.\n",
    "\n",
    "### General Form\n",
    "$$ax + by + c = 0$$\n",
    "This can be rearranged into the slope-intercept form:\n",
    "$$by = -ax - c$$\n",
    "$$y = \\left(\\frac{-a}{b}\\right)x - \\left(\\frac{c}{b}\\right)$$\n",
    "* Here, slope $m = -\\frac{a}{b}$ and intercept $= -\\frac{c}{b}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vector Form\n",
    "We can represent the variables $(x, y)$ as features $(x_1, x_2)$ and coefficients $(a, b)$ as weights $(w_1, w_2)$.\n",
    "$$w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + b = 0$$\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{w}^T\\mathbf{x} + b = 0$$\n",
    "* **$\\mathbf{w}$**: Weight vector $\\begin{bmatrix} w_1 \\\\ w_2 \\end{bmatrix}$\n",
    "* **$\\mathbf{x}$**: Feature vector $\\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\end{bmatrix}$\n",
    "* **$b$**: Bias (intercept) term.\n",

    "## 2. Equation of a 3D Plane and Hyperplane (n-Dimensions)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3D Plane\n",
    "Extending the 2D vector form to 3 dimensions:\n",
    "$$w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + w_3x_3 + b = 0$$\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{w}^T\\mathbf{x} + b = 0$$\n",
    "where $\\mathbf{w} = \\begin{bmatrix} w_1 \\\\ w_2 \\\\ w_3 \\end{bmatrix}$ and $\\mathbf{x} = \\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\\\ x_3 \\end{bmatrix}$.\n",

    "Generalizing to $n$ dimensions:\n",

    "## 3. Geometric Interpretation (Passing through Origin)\n",
    "\n",
    "If the hyperplane passes through the origin $(0,0,\\dots,0)$, the intercept $b$ becomes 0.\n",
    "The equation simplifies to:\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{w}^T\\mathbf{x} = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Orthogonality\n",
    "The term $\\mathbf{w}^T\\mathbf{x}$ is the dot product of vectors $\\mathbf{w}$ and $\\mathbf{x}$:\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{w} \\cdot \\mathbf{x} = \\|\\mathbf{w}\\| \\|\\mathbf{x}\\| \\cos\\theta = 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For this to be zero (assuming non-zero vectors), $\\cos\\theta$ must be 0, which means $\\theta = 90^\\circ$.\n",
    "* **Conclusion**: The weight vector $\\mathbf{w}$ is always **perpendicular (orthogonal)** to the hyperplane $\\Pi$ (or line in 2D).\n",
    "    * $\\mathbf{w} \\perp \\Pi$"
